# ðŸ¤– Blocks Explorer

Simple Apollo's GraphQL API for blocks from Bitcoin's blockchain.

- Built with Apollo and REST Data Sources

# Caching

- For caching in this project optimal setup would be Cache Aside strategy with LRU policy
- Caching can be implemented at two levels in Apollo - GraphQL level and Data Fetching level
  - In this project GraphQL resources caching is used (as described in [documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/caching/))
  - Also, caching together with requests deduplication is implemented in Data Sources itself (as described [in this post](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/graphql/how-apollo-rest-data-source-caches-api-calls/))
  - Cache population on start is not implemented for the simplicity reason
- For production setup I would have a separate instance with Redis or Memcached
  - To implement a single cache layer for multiple web server node instances
- For development setup I just used a simple built-in caching instruments from Apollo

# Limitation

- Build and run scripts are not fully production-ready, they are not properly optimized
- Lots of things like proper validation are simplified
- It's still pretty naive implementation of blockchain-like API
